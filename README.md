With this app you can use your YI LITE action camera as a wifi webcam in your computer!

## Getting Started
As this is a prototype you will need to build it using Visual Studio Community 2019, just open the YiWebcam.sln.

The software is very simple and ease to port to any other code language, I did't have time for finish it, so, feel free to try new things with this! YI LITE was a awesome camera, and in some cases, better than the GO PRO, it's really sad how YI just threw away their action cams as trash...

I'm not sure this is a good way to use it as a webcam, I still think reverse engineering the vanilla firmware can give a better result, as far I know there lots os features thar is locked and we can access it if we find a way to decopile or create a new firmware, but, as this camera become more and more hard to find, is a good idea to try this project or is just a wast of time?! :(

### How to use
This prototype uses the default firmware, no need to hack!
Connect your YI LITE action camera by wifi
Execute the yilite-webcam application and wait to it connect and start the YI LITE, it well beep when done
Inside OBS, create a media source and connect using the address rtsp://192.168.42.1/live
